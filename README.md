# DSP-Project
The project consists of two parts. The first part is the encoding part where the user can enter strings so they get encoded to signals data. 
A sound can be heard in this part. Then the signals will be sent into a decoder in order to bring back their original strings.
Two methods were used to decoded the signals, Frequency analysis (Fourier transform) and Narrow bandpass Filters.
